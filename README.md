# Stamper
LAHacks 2020 Submission!

Stamper is a simple art application. Create shapes and "stamp" them together to make art! Built using Rust & Nannou the creative coding framework for Rust: https://nannou.cc/ 

## How to run:
* Install Rust 2018 or higher
* Clone this directory and navigate to it
* Enter: ``` cargo run ```

## TODO & Roadmap
* Fix bug where shapes are not layered properly 
* Add ability to download your creation 
* Stamping with friends! (Stretch goal but would be fun!)
* WASM Build (?)

## Special Thanks:
To the Nannou team for providing the example and Nannou slack for providing help with issues!
